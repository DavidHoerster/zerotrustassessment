# Workshop Cobranding Guide

## Overview
This guide provides you with instructions on how to properly co-brand the Microsoft Zero Trust Workshop workbook.

## Updating Logos
The Zero Trust Workshop Excel file provides a place for you to co-brand the workbook with your organization's logo. Replace the Contoso name and logo with your own on the "Home" tab. Ensure your logo has sufficient color contrast with the background. Be sure you follow any brand guidelines for minimum clear space or minimum size of your logo.

Do not remove, replace, move, or alter the Microsoft logo in the workbook in any way.

### To change your logo
Select the Contoso logo and select **Picture Format** in the ribbon. Click **Change Picture > This Device** and select an image file of your logo. Use a PNG or SVG file whenever possible, as these file formats support transparency.

With your newly added logo selected, click **Picture Format > Picture Border** and select **No Outline**. This will remove the magenta border.

Click **Picture Format > Alt Text** in the ribbon and replace "Contoso" with your organization's name.
