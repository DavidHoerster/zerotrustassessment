# 006: Rollout CA with device controls

## Overview

Update your CA policies to include controls based on device state. This is a key element of a zero trust strategy for user access. The possible controls are:
* Require Compliant Device: Use this control for devices that enrolled in MDM 
* Require Entra Hybrid Joined device: Use this control for devices that are not managed in MDM yet, which rely on Group Policy Objects, or similar on-premises management tools.
