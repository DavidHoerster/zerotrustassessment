# 173: AMB provisioning

## Overview

Provisioning macOS devices using Apple Business Manager (ABM) in Microsoft Intune streamlines device management and enhances security. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to AMB Provisioning

1. **Set Up Apple Business Manager (ABM)**:
   - Ensure your organization is enrolled in Apple Business Manager.
   - Link ABM with Microsoft Intune by obtaining an Apple MDM push certificate.

2. **Add Devices to ABM**:
   - Purchase devices through an authorized Apple reseller and assign them to your ABM account.
   - Alternatively, manually add existing devices to ABM.

3. **Configure Enrollment Program Token**:
   - In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Apple enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens**.
   - Create a new token and upload the server token file from ABM.

4. **Assign Devices to Intune**:
   - In ABM, assign the devices to the MDM server token created in Intune.
   - This ensures that devices are automatically enrolled in Intune when they are turned on and connected to the internet.

5. **Create and Assign Profiles**:
   - In Intune, create an enrollment profile specifying the settings and configurations for the devices.
   - Assign this profile to the devices in ABM.

6. **Deploy Devices**:
   - Distribute the devices to users. When they turn on the devices, they will automatically enroll in Intune and receive the assigned configurations.

### Benefits

- **Automated Enrollment**: Devices are automatically enrolled in Intune, reducing manual setup time.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures devices are managed and compliant with organizational policies from the moment they are activated.
- **Streamlined Management**: Simplifies the deployment and management of macOS devices across the organization.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all devices have a consistent configuration and security posture.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Setting up ABM and integrating it with Intune can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Dependency on Apple**: Requires purchasing devices through Apple or authorized resellers to take full advantage of ABM.
- **Limited to Corporate Devices**: Primarily designed for corporate-owned devices, not suitable for BYOD scenarios.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Seamless Setup**: Users receive devices that are pre-configured and ready to use, reducing setup time.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on new policies and procedures.
- **Enhanced Security**: Users benefit from improved security measures, reducing the risk of data breaches.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Provisioning macOS devices with ABM in Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures that devices are continuously verified and compliant before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
