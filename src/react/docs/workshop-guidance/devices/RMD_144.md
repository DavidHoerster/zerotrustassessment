# 144: Delivery Optimization

## Overview
Delivery Optimization for Windows devices in Microsoft Intune is a feature designed to reduce bandwidth consumption when downloading updates and applications. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Benefits
1. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Delivery Optimization reduces the amount of bandwidth used by allowing devices to share updates and apps with each other, rather than downloading them individually from the internet.
2. **Faster Updates**: By using peer-to-peer sharing, updates can be distributed more quickly across devices.
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for expensive bandwidth upgrades, especially in environments with limited internet connectivity.
4. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows you to manage Delivery Optimization settings from a single console, simplifying administration.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring Delivery Optimization settings can be complex and may require careful planning.
2. **Network Configuration**: Requires proper network configuration to ensure optimal performance and security.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Some older devices or specific network configurations might not fully support all Delivery Optimization settings.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Performance**: Users experience faster update downloads, reducing downtime.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Properly configured Delivery Optimization can be deployed with minimal disruption to users.

### Steps to Deploy Delivery Optimization
1. **Create a Profile**: Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center. Navigate to Devices > Configuration profiles > Create profile.
2. **Select Platform and Profile Type**: Choose Windows 10 and later as the platform, and select Templates > Delivery Optimization.
3. **Configure Settings**: Define how you want updates and apps to download. This includes settings like download mode, bandwidth limits, and caching options.
4. **Assign Profile**: Assign the profile to the appropriate groups of devices or users.
5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the deployment and make adjustments as needed.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying Delivery Optimization through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Delivery Optimization settings can be configured to ensure secure peer-to-peer sharing within trusted networks.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated settings help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By managing update distribution centrally, Delivery Optimization reduces the potential attack surface.
