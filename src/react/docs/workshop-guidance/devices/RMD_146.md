# 146: Store Apps

## Overview

Using **Microsoft Store** apps with Intune offers streamlined app management and enhanced security, crucial for a Zero Trust environment. Intune allows administrators to centrally deploy, update, and monitor apps from the Microsoft Store.

The Microsoft Store supports Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, desktop apps packaged in .msix, and now Win32 apps packaged in .exe or .msi installers.

Microsoft Store applications keep updating automatically, by default.
