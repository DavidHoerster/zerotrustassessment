# 132: MDM based policies for Wi-Fi

## Overview
Deploying Wi-Fi profiles to Windows devices using Microsoft Intune is a streamlined way to ensure that devices can securely and automatically connect to your organization's Wi-Fi network. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows you to manage Wi-Fi settings from a single console, simplifying the deployment process.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all devices have the same Wi-Fi settings, reducing configuration errors.
3. **Security**: Supports secure authentication methods, such as WPA2-Enterprise, enhancing network security.
4. **User Convenience**: Users can connect to the Wi-Fi network without manually entering settings, improving their experience.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring Wi-Fi profiles, especially with advanced security settings, can be complex.
2. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance is required to update Wi-Fi settings or troubleshoot connectivity issues.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Some older devices or specific network configurations might not fully support all Wi-Fi settings.

### Impact on End Users
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Users experience seamless connectivity to the corporate Wi-Fi network without manual configuration.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Properly configured Wi-Fi profiles reduce the risk of connectivity issues, minimizing downtime.
- **User Training**: Minimal training might be required to inform users about the new Wi-Fi setup.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying Wi-Fi profiles through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Wi-Fi profiles can enforce secure authentication methods, ensuring only authorized devices connect to the network.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated Wi-Fi settings help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By managing Wi-Fi settings centrally, you reduce the risk of misconfigurations that could be exploited.
