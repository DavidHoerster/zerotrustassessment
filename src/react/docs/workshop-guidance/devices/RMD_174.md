# 174: Device config policies through settings catalog

## Overview

Deploying device configuration policies through the settings catalog for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune allows for granular control over device settings. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy Device Configuration Policies through Settings Catalog

1. **Access Intune Admin Center**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

2. **Create a Configuration Profile**:
   - Go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
   - Select **macOS** for the platform and **Settings catalog** for the profile type.

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - In the settings catalog, browse or search for the settings you want to configure.
   - Add the desired settings to your profile. These can include restrictions on built-in apps, password policies, network configurations, and more.

4. **Assign the Profile**:
   - Assign the profile to the appropriate user or device groups.
   - Review and save the profile.

5. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Use the Intune admin center to monitor the deployment status and ensure the policies are applied correctly.

### Benefits

- **Granular Control**: Provides detailed control over various device settings, enhancing security and compliance.
- **Unified Management**: Manage all device settings from a single console, simplifying administration.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale policies as the number of macOS devices grows.
- **Flexibility**: Customize settings to meet specific organizational needs.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring detailed settings can be time-consuming and may require a deep understanding of macOS and Intune.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some settings may not be supported on older macOS versions.
- **Learning Curve**: IT staff may need training to effectively use the settings catalog.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Seamless Experience**: Properly configured settings can lead to a smoother user experience with fewer disruptions.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on new policies and procedures.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying device configuration policies through the settings catalog aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures that devices are continuously verified and compliant before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
