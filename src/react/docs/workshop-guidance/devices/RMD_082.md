# 082: Review security, compliance, resource access requirements (Certs/Wi-Fi/VPN)

## Overview
When planning to deploy certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN profiles to Android devices in Intune, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

### 1. **Enrollment Method**
- **Choose the Right Enrollment Type**: Decide between Android Enterprise options (like Work Profile, Fully Managed, or Dedicated devices) based on your organization's needs. Each method has different capabilities and management levels.

### 2. **Certificate Management**
- **SCEP and PKCS Certificates**: Ensure you have a clear strategy for deploying certificates. SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) is commonly used for automated certificate provisioning. Make sure your devices are configured to accept these certificates for Wi-Fi and VPN authentication¹(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-android).
- **Trusted Root Certificates**: Deploy trusted root certificates to establish a secure connection. Ensure that these certificates are correctly configured and distributed to devices²(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/certificates-trusted-root).

### 3. **Wi-Fi Configuration**
- **Profile Settings**: When creating Wi-Fi profiles, specify the SSID, security type (e.g., WPA2), and authentication methods (like EAP-TLS or PEAP). Ensure that the settings align with your organization's network requirements¹(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-android).
- **Hidden Networks**: Decide whether to hide the SSID from users. If you choose to hide it, ensure users know how to connect to the network.

### 4. **VPN Configuration**
- **VPN Type**: Choose the appropriate VPN type (e.g., IKEv2, L2TP) based on your security needs and compatibility with your infrastructure.
- **Conditional Access**: Implement conditional access policies to ensure that only compliant devices can connect to the VPN. This adds an extra layer of security.

### 5. **User Experience**
- **Ease of Use**: Consider the user experience when deploying these profiles. Ensure that the enrollment process is straightforward and that users receive clear instructions on how to connect to Wi-Fi and VPN.
- **Support and Training**: Provide adequate support and training for users to help them understand how to use the deployed profiles effectively.

### 6. **Testing and Validation**
- **Pilot Testing**: Before a full rollout, conduct pilot testing with a small group of users to identify any issues with the deployment of certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN profiles.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: After deployment, monitor the performance and gather user feedback to make necessary adjustments.

### 7. **Security Policies**
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensure that all profiles comply with your organization’s security policies. Regularly review and update these policies to address any emerging threats or changes in technology.
