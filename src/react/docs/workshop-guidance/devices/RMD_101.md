# 101: Remote actions

## Overview

## Benefits

**Enhanced Security:** Remote actions allow IT administrators to quickly respond to security incidents. For example, if a device is lost or stolen, they can remotely wipe or lock the device to protect sensitive data

**Convenience:** Administrators can perform tasks like resetting passwords, collecting diagnostic data, or pushing updates without needing physical access to the device

**Efficiency:** Remote actions streamline device management, reducing the need for on-site support and minimizing downtime for users

## Drawbacks

**Privacy Concerns:** Users might be concerned about their privacy, especially if remote actions include capabilities like screen sharing or full control

**Dependency on Connectivity:** Remote actions require the device to be connected to the internet and powered on, which might not always be feasible

**Potential Misuse:** If not properly managed, remote actions could be misused, leading to unintended consequences such as data loss or unauthorized access

## Impact on End Users

**User Experience:** Users might experience interruptions if remote actions are performed during their active use of the device. However, these actions are often necessary to maintain security and compliance

**Support and Training:** Users may need guidance on what to expect from remote actions and how to report issues if they arise

**Security Assurance:** Knowing that their devices can be remotely managed and secured can provide users with peace of mind, especially in case of loss or theft

## Relation to Zero Trust

**Continuous Monitoring:** Remote actions support the Zero Trust principle of continuous monitoring and validation. Administrators can ensure devices remain compliant with security policies

**Least Privilege:** By using remote actions, organizations can enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that devices only have the necessary access and configurations

**Conditional Access:** Remote actions can be integrated with conditional access policies to ensure that only compliant devices can access corporate resources
