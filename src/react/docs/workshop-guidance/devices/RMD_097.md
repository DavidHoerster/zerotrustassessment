# 097: Userless Enrollment

## Overview

## Benefits

**Simplified Management:** Userless enrollment allows IT administrators to manage devices without associating them with specific users. This is ideal for shared devices used in environments like kiosks or frontline work

**Consistency:** Devices can be configured with a standard set of apps and policies, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices

**Security:** Devices are enrolled with security policies that protect corporate data, even when multiple users access the same device

**Efficiency:** Streamlines the deployment process, as devices can be quickly set up and deployed without needing individual user accounts

## Drawbacks

**Limited Personalization:** Since devices are not tied to individual users, personalization options are limited. This can impact user experience for tasks requiring personal settings

**App Compatibility:** Some apps that require user-specific data, like email clients, may not function optimally on userless devices

**Complex Setup:** Initial setup and configuration can be complex, requiring careful planning and execution

## Impact on End Users

**Shared Use:** Devices are typically shared among multiple users, which can be beneficial in environments like retail or healthcare where devices are used for specific tasks

**Access Control:** Users might need to sign in and out of apps frequently, which can be less convenient compared to having a dedicated device

**Training:** Users may require training to understand how to use shared devices effectively and securely

## Relation to Zero Trust

**Device Compliance:** Userless enrollment supports the Zero Trust principle by ensuring that every device accessing corporate resources is compliant with security policies

**Least Privilege:**  Devices are configured to provide only the necessary access and functionality, aligning with the Zero Trust principle of least privilege

**Continuous Monitoring:** Intune continuously monitors enrolled devices for compliance, ensuring they remain secure and meet organizational policies
