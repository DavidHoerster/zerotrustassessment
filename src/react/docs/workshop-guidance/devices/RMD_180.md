# 180: App management

## Overview

Managing apps on macOS devices using Microsoft Intune involves several steps to ensure seamless deployment, security, and compliance. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy App Management

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary licenses for Microsoft Intune.
   - Verify that macOS devices meet the system requirements.

2. **Add Apps to Intune**:
   - In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Apps > All apps**.
   - Select **Add** and choose the type of app you want to deploy (e.g., macOS LOB apps, Microsoft 365 apps, etc.).
   - Configure the app information, including name, description, and publisher.

3. **Assign Apps to Devices**:
   - After adding the app, go to **Assignments**.
   - Assign the app to the relevant device groups or users.
   - Configure the installation behavior (e.g., required, available for enrolled devices, etc.).

4. **Configure App Protection Policies**:
   - Navigate to **Apps > App protection policies**.
   - Create and configure policies to protect corporate data within the apps.
   - Assign these policies to the relevant user groups².

5. **Monitor App Deployment**:
   - Use the Intune admin center to monitor the deployment status of apps.
   - Check for any installation issues and troubleshoot as needed.

### Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the deployment and management of apps across all macOS devices from a single console.
- **Enhanced Security**: App protection policies help safeguard corporate data within apps.
- **Compliance**: Ensures that apps comply with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

### Drawbacks

- **Complex Setup**: Initial configuration can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Resource Intensive**: May require significant system resources, potentially impacting device performance.
- **User Experience**: Users might experience interruptions during the deployment and configuration process.

### Impact on End Users

- **Performance**: Users might notice a slight decrease in performance due to the additional security processes running in the background.
- **Seamless Access**: Users will benefit from seamless access to corporate apps without needing to enter credentials repeatedly.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications related to app installations and updates.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying app management for macOS devices aligns with the Zero Trust security model by ensuring that:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every access request is continuously verified, regardless of where the request originates.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Assume Breach**: The system is designed with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, ensuring robust detection and response mechanisms.
