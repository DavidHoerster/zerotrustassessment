# 165: Custom Compliance Policies

## Overview

To expand on Intuneâ€™s built-in device compliance options, you can use policies for custom compliance settings for managed Windows devices. Custom settings provide flexibility to base compliance on the settings that are available on a device without having to wait for Intune to add these settings to the built-in policy templates.

After you deploy custom compliance settings and devices report back, you can view the results alongside the built-in compliance setting details in the Microsoft Intune admin center. Custom compliance settings can be used for conditional access decisions in the same way built-in compliance settings are. Together they form a compound rule set, equally affecting the device compliance state.
