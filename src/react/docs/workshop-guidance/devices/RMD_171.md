# 171: Review current management needs

## Overview

Reviewing the current management needs for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune involves several key steps and considerations. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Steps to Review Current Management Needs

1. **Assess Current Environment**:
   - Identify the number of macOS devices in your organization.
   - Determine the current management tools and policies in place.

2. **Define Management Goals**:
   - Establish what you aim to achieve with macOS management (e.g., security, compliance, user experience).

3. **Evaluate Intune Capabilities**:
   - Review the features and capabilities of Microsoft Intune for macOS management, such as device enrollment, policy configuration, and app deployment¹.

4. **Plan for Enrollment**:
   - Decide on the enrollment methods (e.g., Apple Automated Device Enrollment, BYOD).
   - Set up the necessary prerequisites, such as Apple MDM push certificates¹.

5. **Configure Policies and Profiles**:
   - Create and assign compliance policies, configuration profiles, and app deployment settings tailored to macOS devices.

6. **Test and Validate**:
   - Pilot the configurations with a small group of users to identify any issues.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

7. **Rollout and Monitor**:
   - Deploy the configurations to all macOS devices.
   - Continuously monitor and update policies as needed.

### Benefits

- **Unified Management**: Manage macOS devices alongside other platforms within a single console.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement security policies and compliance checks to protect corporate data.
- **Improved User Experience**: Streamline device setup and access to resources.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale management as the number of macOS devices grows.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Setting up and configuring Intune for macOS can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Learning Curve**: IT staff may need training to effectively use Intune for macOS management.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some older macOS versions may not support all Intune features.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Seamless Access**: Users benefit from streamlined access to corporate resources and fewer authentication prompts.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on new policies and procedures.
- **Enhanced Security**: Users experience improved security measures, reducing the risk of data breaches.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Reviewing and managing macOS devices in Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensuring that devices and users are continuously verified before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforcing policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limiting access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
