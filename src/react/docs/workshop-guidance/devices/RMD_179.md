# 179: Certificates / Wi-Fi / VPN

## Overview

Deploying certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN settings for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Steps to Deploy Certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN

1. **Certificates**:
   - **Create Certificate Profiles**: In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Devices > Configuration profiles** and create a profile for PKCS or SCEP certificates.
   - **Deploy Certificates**: Assign the certificate profiles to the relevant device groups to ensure secure authentication for Wi-Fi and VPN connections.

2. **Wi-Fi**:
   - **Create Wi-Fi Profiles**: Go to **Devices > Configuration profiles** and create a new profile for Wi-Fi settings.
   - **Configure Basic Settings**: Set the SSID, security type (e.g., WPA/WPA2), and other basic settings.
   - **Configure Enterprise Settings**: For enterprise networks, configure EAP settings and associate the Wi-Fi profile with the certificate profile created earlier.
   - **Deploy Wi-Fi Profiles**: Assign the Wi-Fi profiles to the relevant device groups.

3. **VPN**:
   - **Create VPN Profiles**: In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Devices > Configuration profiles** and create a new profile for VPN settings.
   - **Configure VPN Settings**: Set the VPN server address, authentication method (e.g., certificates), and connection type (e.g., Cisco AnyConnect, SonicWall).
   - **Deploy VPN Profiles**: Assign the VPN profiles to the relevant device groups.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Certificates provide strong authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Automates Wi-Fi and VPN connections, improving user experience and productivity.
- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the deployment and management of network settings across all macOS devices from a single console.

### Drawbacks

- **Complex Setup**: Initial configuration can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Resource Intensive**: May require significant system resources, potentially impacting device performance.
- **User Experience**: Users might experience interruptions during the deployment and configuration process.

### Impact on End Users

- **Performance**: Users might notice a slight decrease in performance due to the additional security processes running in the background.
- **Seamless Access**: Users will benefit from seamless access to corporate resources without needing to enter credentials repeatedly.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications related to network connections and security events.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN settings aligns with the Zero Trust security model by ensuring that:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every access request is continuously verified, regardless of where the request originates.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Assume Breach**: The system is designed with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, ensuring robust detection and response mechanisms.
