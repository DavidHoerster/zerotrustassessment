# 142: Feature Updates

## Overview

Feature Update policies in Intune allow you to control which Windows feature updates are installed on your devices. You can specify a target version for Windows 10 or Windows 11, ensuring devices update to and remain on that version until you change the policy. This helps maintain stability and compatibility across your devices. Additionally, safeguard holds can temporarily block updates if there are known issues, preventing potential disruption.

Intune provides built-in reports to monitor the status of feature updates. These reports help you track which devices have successfully updated and identify any issues. To utilize these reports, you need to enable Windows diagnostic data collection on your devices. Key reports include the Feature Update Status report, which shows the update status of devices, and the Update Compliance report, which provides insights into overall compliance with your update policies.
