# 148: WDAC / App Control

## Overview
Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) and Windows App Control are powerful tools for managing and securing applications on Windows devices. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: WDAC helps prevent unauthorized applications from running, reducing the risk of malware and other security threats.
2. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory and organizational security requirements by enforcing strict application control policies.
3. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows you to manage WDAC policies from a single console, simplifying administration.
4. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple policy formats and configurations, allowing you to tailor policies to your organization's needs.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring WDAC policies can be complex and time-consuming, especially for large organizations.
2. **Potential for Application Blockage**: Legitimate applications might be blocked if not properly whitelisted, requiring careful planning and testing.
3. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance is required to update policies and ensure they remain effective.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security without needing to take additional actions.
- **Potential Disruption**: Users might experience disruption if legitimate applications are blocked, requiring support intervention.
- **User Training**: Some users might need training to understand the new application control policies.

### Steps to Deploy WDAC
1. **Plan Your Deployment**: Identify the devices you'll manage with WDAC and split them into deployment rings to control the speed and scale of the deployment.
2. **Create a Policy**: In Intune, create a new WDAC policy. Navigate to Device configuration > Profiles > Create profile. Choose Windows 10 and later as the platform, and select Endpoint Protection from the profile type drop-down.
3. **Configure Settings**: Define the applications and scripts that are allowed to run. You can use built-in policies or create custom policies using OMA-URI settings.
4. **Convert Policy to Binary**: Convert your WDAC policy XML to binary using PowerShell, as WDAC policies must be in binary format for deployment.
5. **Deploy the Policy**: Assign the policy to the appropriate groups of devices or users. Ensure to test the policy in audit mode before enforcing it to monitor and adjust as neededÂ².
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the deployment and make adjustments based on feedback and observed behavior.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying WDAC through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: WDAC enforces strict application control, ensuring only trusted applications can run.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated policies help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By controlling which applications can run, WDAC reduces the potential attack surface.
