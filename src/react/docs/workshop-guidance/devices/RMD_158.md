# 158: MDM based policies for security baselines

## Overview

Security Baselines in Intune are predefined sets of security configurations based on best practices and industry standards. They help ensure that devices are consistently and securely configured by applying recommended settings for features like password policies, encryption, and firewall rules.

These baselines simplify the process of securing devices, reduce the risk of misconfigurations, and help maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. By deploying security baselines, organizations can enforce uniform security settings across all managed devices, enhancing overall security posture.
