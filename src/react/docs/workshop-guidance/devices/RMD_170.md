# 170: Remote Log Collection

## Overview

**Remote log collection** in Intune allows administrators to gather diagnostic logs from managed devices without needing physical access. Admins can collect logs remotely to diagnose and resolve issues quickly, reducing the need for on-site support, and are collected without interrupting the user.
