# 134: Browser

## Overview

Microsoft Edge is designed with enterprise security in mind, making it a robust choice for organizations. Here are some key points about its security features and benefits:

### **Enterprise Security Features of Microsoft Edge**
1. **Built-in Security Tools**: Edge includes features like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which helps protect against phishing and malware by blocking malicious websites and downloads.
2. **Data Protection**: It supports data leak prevention (DLP) capabilities, ensuring sensitive information is not inadvertently shared.
3. **Separation of Work and Personal Browsing**: Edge for Business separates work and personal browsing into dedicated browser windows, each with its own favorites, cache, and storage locations. This prevents accidental sharing of sensitive work data.

### **Benefits of Using Microsoft Edge**
1. **Integration with Microsoft 365**: Edge works seamlessly with Microsoft 365 apps, enhancing productivity and reducing the need for context switching.
2. **Performance**: Features like Sleeping Tabs help minimize resource usage, making it a high-performing browser even with multiple tabs open.
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Edge is available on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

### **Relation to Zero Trust**
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default. Microsoft Edge aligns with Zero Trust principles in several ways:
1. **Continuous Verification**: Edge continuously verifies user identity and device health before granting access to resources.
2. **Least Privilege Access**: It ensures users only have access to the data and applications they need, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Integration with Zero Trust Architectures**: Edge supports Zero Trust architectures by integrating with Microsoftâ€™s security tools, providing a secure browsing experience that fits within a broader Zero Trust strategy.
