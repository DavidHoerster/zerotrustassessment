# 059: Compliance policy

## Overview
When managing iOS/iPadOS devices using Microsoft Intune, you can configure various compliance settings to help protect your organizational resources. Let's explore some key settings:

1. **Email Compliance**:
   - You can require a managed email account on the device. If an existing email account matches the Intune email profile, the device is considered noncompliant. To be compliant, the user must remove the existing email settings so that Intune can install the managed email profile¹.

2. **Device Health**:
   - For rooted (jailbroken) devices, you can mark them as noncompliant. Additionally, you can set an allowed threat level:
     - **Secured**: The device can't have any threats.
     - **Low**: Only low-level threats are acceptable.
     - **Medium**: Low or medium-level threats are allowed¹.

3. **Creating a Compliance Policy**:
   - Sign in to the Microsoft Intune portal.
   - Navigate to **Devices > Compliance policies** and click **Create policy**.
   - Select the platform as **iOS/iPadOS** and configure the desired settings².

Remember, these settings help maintain security and compliance for your iOS devices within your organization.
