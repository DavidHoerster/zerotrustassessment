# 178: Deploy MDM based policies for EDR/AV

## Overview

Deploying MDM-based policies for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Antivirus (AV) on macOS devices using Microsoft Intune involves several steps. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy MDM-Based Policies for EDR/AV on macOS

1. **Prerequisites and System Requirements**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary licenses for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
   - Verify that macOS devices meet the system requirementsÂ¹.

2. **Create System Configuration Profiles**:
   - In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Devices > Configuration profiles**.
   - Create profiles for system extensions, network extensions, full disk access, and other necessary configurations.

3. **Approve System Extensions**:
   - Go to **Devices > Configuration profiles** and create a new profile.
   - Select **macOS** as the platform and **Extensions** as the profile type.
   - Add the required system extensions.

4. **Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**:
   - Download the onboarding package from the Microsoft Defender Security Center.
   - Deploy the package using Intune by creating a new app and assigning it to the relevant device groups.

5. **Configure EDR Policies**:
   - In the Intune admin center, go to **Endpoint security > Endpoint detection and response**.
   - Create and configure EDR policies, including onboarding packages and other settings.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Provides advanced threat detection and response capabilities, improving overall security posture.
- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the management of security policies across all macOS devices from a single console.
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure devices comply with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Initial setup and configuration can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Resource Intensive**: May require significant system resources, potentially impacting device performance.
- **User Experience**: Users might experience interruptions during the deployment and configuration process.

### Impact on End Users

- **Performance**: Users might notice a slight decrease in performance due to the additional security processes running in the background.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications related to security events and updates.
- **Access Restrictions**: Some applications or actions might be restricted based on the security policies applied.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying MDM-based policies for EDR/AV on macOS devices aligns with the Zero Trust security model by ensuring that:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every access request is continuously verified, regardless of where the request originates.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Assume Breach**: The system is designed with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, ensuring robust detection and response mechanisms.
