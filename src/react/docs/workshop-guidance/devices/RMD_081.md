### Key Differences Between BYOD and Corporate Enrollment

- **Data Management**:
  - **BYOD**: Focuses on managing corporate data while preserving user privacy. Only the work profile is managed.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Provides full management capabilities, allowing IT to enforce policies on the entire device.

- **User Experience**:
  - **BYOD**: Users maintain control over their personal data and can choose to enroll only for corporate access.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Users may have limited control over device settings, as IT manages the entire device.

- **Enrollment Process**:
  - **BYOD**: Typically involves user-initiated enrollment through the Company Portal app or web-based methods.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Often involves automated processes through Android Enterprise features like Zero Touch Enrollment or bulk enrollment methods.
