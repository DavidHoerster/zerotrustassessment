# 183: Local account management

## Overview

Managing local accounts on macOS devices using Microsoft Intune can streamline administrative tasks and enhance security. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy Local Account Management

1. **Access Intune Admin Center**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

2. **Create a Configuration Profile**:
   - Go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
   - Select **macOS** for the platform and **Templates** for the profile type.

3. **Configure Account Settings**:
   - Choose the **Account configuration** template.
   - Define the settings for creating or managing local accounts, such as account type (standard or administrator), account name, and passwordÂ³.

4. **Assign the Profile**:
   - Assign the profile to the appropriate user or device groups.
   - Review and save the profile.

5. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Use the Intune admin center to monitor the deployment status and ensure the policies are applied correctly.

### Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Manage local accounts across all macOS devices from a single console.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensure consistent account policies and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Streamlined Administration**: Simplifies the process of creating and managing local accounts.
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure devices comply with organizational policies.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring account settings can be time-consuming and may require a deep understanding of macOS and Intune.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some settings may not be supported on older macOS versions.
- **Learning Curve**: IT staff may need training to effectively manage local accounts.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Seamless Experience**: Properly configured settings can lead to a smoother user experience with fewer disruptions.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on new policies and procedures.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Managing local accounts on macOS devices aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures that devices and users are continuously verified before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
