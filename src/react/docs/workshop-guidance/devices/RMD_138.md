# 138: Disk Encryption (Bitlocker)

## Overview
Deploying BitLocker encryption settings to Windows devices using Microsoft Intune is a robust way to ensure data security across your organization. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: BitLocker encrypts the entire drive, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, especially in cases of device theft or loss.
2. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows you to manage BitLocker settings from a single console, simplifying the deployment and monitoring process.
3. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring data is encrypted and secure.
4. **Recovery Options**: Intune provides built-in recovery key management, making it easier to recover data if needed.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring BitLocker settings, especially for large organizations, can be complex and time-consuming.
2. **Performance Impact**: Encryption can slightly impact device performance, although this is generally minimal with modern hardware.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Enabling BitLocker on devices already using third-party encryption solutions can cause conflicts and potential data loss.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced data security without needing to take additional actions.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Properly configured BitLocker settings can be deployed silently, minimizing disruption to users.
- **Recovery Support**: Users have access to recovery options if they forget their BitLocker PIN or password.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying BitLocker through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Data Security**: BitLocker encryption ensures that data is secure, even if a device is compromised.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated encryption policies help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By encrypting data at rest, BitLocker reduces the potential attack surface.
