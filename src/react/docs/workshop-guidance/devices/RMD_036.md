# 036: Access requirements

## Overview
In Microsoft Intune, the **Mobile Application Management (MAM) Access Requirements** settings for Android devices help ensure that only authorized users can access managed applications. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the available options:

### 1. **Require Authentication**
- **PIN for Access**: Users may be required to enter a PIN to access managed apps. This adds a layer of security by ensuring that only authorized users can open the app.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Options to use biometric methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for accessing managed applications.

### 2. **Session Timeouts**
- **Idle Timeout**: You can set a duration after which the app will automatically log out the user if there is no activity. This helps protect sensitive data if the device is left unattended.

### 3. **Device Compliance**
- **Compliance Policies**: Access can be restricted based on whether the device meets specific compliance criteria, such as having a secure password, being free from malware, or having the latest security updates.

### 4. **Minimum OS Version**
- **OS Version Requirement**: Specify the minimum Android OS version required for accessing managed apps. This ensures that users are on a supported and secure version of the operating system.

### 5. **Block Access**
- **Jailbroken or Rooted Devices**: You can block access to managed apps if the device is detected as jailbroken or rooted, which can compromise security.
