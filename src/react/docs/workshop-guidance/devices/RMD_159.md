# 159: MDM based policies for BitLocker

## Overview

BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature included with Windows that helps protect data by encrypting the entire drive. This ensures that data is inaccessible without proper authentication.

Intune provides several  features for managing and monitoring BitLocker on Windows devices. Administrators can configure policies to set encryption methods and authentication options, ensuring that devices are encrypted with standards like XTS-AES 256-bit and use secure startup methods such as a TPM.

Automatic encryption can be enabled, streamlining the deployment process. 

Compliance policies can be used to ensure that only devices meeting encryption requirements can access corporate resources, maintaining a secure environment.

For monitoring, Intune tracks the encryption status of devices, allowing administrators to see which devices are encrypted. 

Intune can also securely store and retrieves BitLocker recovery keys to Entra, facilitating data recovery if needed. 

Reporting capabilities generate detailed reports on encryption status and compliance, aiding in audits and security management.
