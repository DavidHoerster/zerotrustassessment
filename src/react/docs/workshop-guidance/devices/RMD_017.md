# 017: Review enrolled vs unenrolled for BYOD/Corporate

## Overview
### BYOD vs. Corporate Devices for MDM in Intune for iOS

When managing iOS devices with Microsoft Intune, you have two primary options: **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** and **Corporate-Owned Devices**. Each approach has its own set of enrollment methods, benefits, and implications for your Zero Trust security posture.

#### Enrollment Options

1. **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**:
   - **User Enrollment**: This method allows users to enroll their personal devices while maintaining a separation between personal and corporate data. It uses a Managed Apple ID and provides a limited set of management capabilities.
   - **Device Enrollment**: Users enroll their personal devices through the Intune Company Portal app, which installs a management profile on the device.

2. **Corporate-Owned Devices**:
   - **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**: Formerly known as the Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP), this method is used for devices purchased through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. It allows for zero-touch deployment and supervision of devices.
   - **Apple Configurator**: This method is used for bulk enrollment of devices that are not purchased through Apple Business Manager. It requires physical access to the devices for initial setup.

#### Benefits of Each Method

1. **BYOD**:
   - **Flexibility**: Employees can use their preferred devices, which can increase satisfaction and productivity(https://tminus365.com/corporate-vs-personal-devices-intune/).
   - **Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for the organization to purchase and maintain a large inventory of devices(https://tminus365.com/corporate-vs-personal-devices-intune/).
   - **Privacy**: User Enrollment ensures that personal data remains private and separate from corporate data(https://tminus365.com/corporate-vs-personal-devices-intune/).

2. **Corporate-Owned Devices**:
   - **Enhanced Control**: Provides greater control over device settings, security policies, and app management(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment).
   - **Supervision**: ADE allows devices to be supervised, enabling additional management capabilities such as restricting app installations and enforcing stricter security policies(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment).
   - **Consistency**: Ensures a standardized setup and configuration across all devices, simplifying management and support(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment).

#### Zero Trust Security Posture

1. **BYOD**:
   - **Conditional Access**: Intune can enforce conditional access policies to ensure that only compliant and secure devices can access corporate resources(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).
   - **App Protection Policies**: Intune's Mobile Application Management (MAM) policies can protect corporate data at the app level, even on personal devices(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/05/26/zero-trust-deployment-guide-for-devices/).
   - **Risk-Based Access**: Integrates with mobile threat defense solutions to assess device risk and enforce access controls accordingly(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/05/26/zero-trust-deployment-guide-for-devices/).

2. **Corporate-Owned Devices**:
   - **Comprehensive Management**: Full device management capabilities allow for enforcing strict security policies, such as mandatory encryption, complex passwords, and regular updates(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).
   - **Supervised Mode**: Enables advanced security features like disabling the camera, restricting app installations, and enforcing compliance checks(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).
   - **Endpoint Protection**: Integrates with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide real-time threat detection and automated remediation(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).

By leveraging Intune's capabilities, both BYOD and corporate-owned device strategies can be aligned with Zero Trust principles to ensure secure access to corporate resources while maintaining a high level of user productivity and satisfaction.
