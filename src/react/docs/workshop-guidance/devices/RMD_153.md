# 153: Remote Assistance

## Overview

**Remote Help** is a feature that allows IT support to remotely assist users' devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It integrates with Intune to provide secure, role-based access for troubleshooting. It enhances security by using encrypted connections and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can provide support.

Remote Help is available with an add on license or an Intune Suite license.  For more information about licensing options, see [Microsoft Intune licensing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/licenses).
