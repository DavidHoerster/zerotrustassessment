# 139: Security Baselines

## Overview
Security baselines in Microsoft Intune are pre-configured groups of Windows settings and default values recommended by Microsoft's security teams. They help you quickly apply a consistent security posture across your managed devices. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Security baselines ensure devices adhere to best practices and recommended security settings, reducing vulnerabilities.
2. **Consistency**: Provides a uniform security configuration across all devices, minimizing configuration errors.
3. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory and organizational security requirements.
4. **Simplified Management**: Centralized management of security settings through Intune simplifies administration.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring and customizing security baselines can be complex and time-consuming.
2. **Potential Conflicts**: Baselines might conflict with existing policies or settings, requiring careful planning and testing.
3. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and maintenance are needed to keep baselines current with the latest security recommendations.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security without needing to take additional actions.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Properly deployed baselines can be applied with minimal disruption to users.
- **User Training**: Some users might need training to understand new security settings or changes.

### Deploying Security Baselines
1. **Create a Profile**: In Intune, create a new security baseline profile in the Endpoint Security Blade in the Intune console.
2. **Customize Settings**: Adjust the baseline settings to fit your organization's needs.
3. **Assign to Groups**: Assign the baseline profile to specific groups of devices or users.
4. **Monitor Compliance**: Continuously monitor and adjust the baseline to ensure compliance and address any issues.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying security baselines through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Baselines enforce strict security settings, ensuring only compliant devices access corporate resources.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated baselines help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By enforcing consistent security settings, baselines reduce the potential attack surface.
