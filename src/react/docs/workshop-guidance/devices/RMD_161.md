# 161: Attack surface reduction

## Overview

**Attack Surface Reduction** in Microsoft Intune is designed to minimize vulnerabilities on Windows devices by controlling various behaviors and configurations that can be exploited by malware. It includes several profiles:

- **Attack Surface Reduction Rules**: Targets behaviors commonly used by malware, such as blocking executable files and scripts in Office apps, preventing obfuscated scripts, and stopping suspicious behaviors.
- **Device Control**: Manages and secures removable media and peripherals to prevent unauthorized devices from compromising your systems.
- **Exploit Protection**: Configures settings to protect against exploits that can take advantage of software vulnerabilities.
- **App and Browser Isolation**: Uses Windows Defender Application Guard to isolate potentially harmful content from the rest of the system.
- **Application Control**: Uses Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to control which applications and drivers can run on devices, helping to prevent untrusted applications from executing.
- **Device Control Rules**: Allows administrators to define rules for controlling device access, such as blocking USB drives or other removable media.
