# 136: Enrollment Restrictions

## Overview
Enrollment restriction settings in Microsoft Intune allow you to control which devices can enroll in your organization's management system. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: By restricting which devices can enroll, you can prevent unauthorized or non-compliant devices from accessing corporate resources.
2. **Compliance**: Helps ensure that only devices meeting your organization's security policies can enroll, aiding in regulatory compliance.
3. **Resource Management**: Limits the number of devices a user can enroll, preventing resource overuse and ensuring fair distribution.

### Drawbacks
1. **Complex Configuration**: Setting up and managing enrollment restrictions can be complex and time-consuming.
2. **Potential for User Frustration**: Users may experience frustration if their devices are blocked from enrolling, especially if they are unaware of the restrictions.
3. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance is required to update restrictions as new devices and operating systems are released.

### Impact on End Users
- **Access Issues**: Users might face access issues if their devices do not meet the enrollment criteria.
- **Increased Support Requests**: There may be an increase in support requests from users needing assistance with enrollment.
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from a more secure environment, knowing that only compliant devices are allowed.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Enrollment restrictions in Intune align with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Only devices that meet specific security criteria can enroll, ensuring that only trusted devices access corporate resources.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated restrictions help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By limiting the types and number of devices that can enroll, you reduce the potential attack surface.
