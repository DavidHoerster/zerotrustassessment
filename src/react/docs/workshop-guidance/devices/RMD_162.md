# 162: Account protection

## Overview

**Account protection** in Microsoft Intune's endpoint security is designed to protect user identities and manage local group memberships on Windows devices. It includes:

- **Windows Hello for Business**: Enhances security by replacing passwords with strong two-factor authentication using biometrics or PINs.
- **Credential Guard**: Uses virtualization-based security to isolate and protect credentials from theft.
- **Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS)**: Manages a single local administrator account per device, enforcing password requirements and backing up credentials to Active Directory or Microsoft Entra.
- **Local Group Management**: Add, remove, or replace members of built-in local groups, such as the Administrators group, ensuring only authorized users have elevated privileges
