# 177: Firewall

## Overview

Deploying firewall settings for macOS devices using Microsoft Intune helps enhance security by controlling network traffic. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy Firewall

1. **Access Intune Admin Center**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

2. **Create a Firewall Policy**:
   - Go to **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create policy**.
   - Select **macOS** for the platform⁴.

3. **Configure Firewall Settings**:
   - Define the firewall rules and settings, such as enabling the firewall, configuring inbound and outbound rules, and setting logging options⁴.
   - You can also use the settings catalog to configure individual firewall settings.

4. **Assign the Policy**:
   - Assign the firewall policy to the appropriate user or device groups.
   - Review and save the policy.

5. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Use the Intune admin center to monitor the deployment status and ensure the policies are applied correctly.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Controls network traffic to and from macOS devices, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Unified Management**: Manage firewall settings alongside other device configurations in Intune.
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure devices comply with organizational security policies.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale policies as the number of macOS devices grows.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring detailed firewall settings can be time-consuming and may require a deep understanding of macOS and Intune⁴.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some settings may not be supported on older macOS versions.
- **Learning Curve**: IT staff may need training to effectively manage firewall settings.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced protection against network threats, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Seamless Experience**: Properly configured settings can lead to a smoother user experience with fewer disruptions.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on new policies and procedures.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying firewall settings for macOS devices aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures that devices are continuously verified and compliant before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
