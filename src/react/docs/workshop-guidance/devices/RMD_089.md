# 089: Enrollment Restrictions

## Overview

1. **Device Platform Restrictions**:
   - You can restrict device enrollment based on the platform (e.g., Android, iOS, macOS, Windows 10/11).
   - For Android, Intune is ending support for device administrator management on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) after December 31, 2024. This means device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable for such devices.
   - You can block specific Android platforms (e.g., Android device administrator, Android Enterprise work profile) based on your organization's needs.

2. **Device Limit Restrictions**:
   - Set a limit on the number of devices a user can enroll (from 1 to 15).
   - Useful for managing device sprawl and ensuring control over enrolled devices.

3. **Benefits**:
   - Enhanced security: By restricting certain platforms or limiting device enrollments, you can better secure your organization's data.
   - Efficient management: Prevent excessive device enrollments, streamlining administration.

4. **Drawbacks**:
   - Overly restrictive policies may inconvenience users or hinder productivity.
   - Balancing security with user experience is crucial.

5. **Impact on End Users**:
   - Users may encounter limitations when enrolling devices, especially if they exceed the allowed device limit.
   - Transition away from Android device administrator may require adjustments for existing users.
