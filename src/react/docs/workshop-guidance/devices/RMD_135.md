# 135: VDI Strategy

## Overview

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solutions like Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 offer several security benefits for enterprises, aligning well with the Zero Trust security model. Here's how they contribute to enterprise security and their relation to Zero Trust:

### **Relation to Zero Trust**
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default. Both Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 align with Zero Trust principles in the following ways:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Both solutions can continuously verify user identities and device health before granting access to resources.
2. **Use Least Privilege Access**: They ensure users have only the necessary access to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Assume Breach**: By centralizing data and using advanced threat protection, these solutions minimize the impact of potential breaches and enhance overall security.
