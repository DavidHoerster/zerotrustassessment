# 140: Cloud LAPS

## Overview
Cloud Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) for Windows devices in Microsoft Intune is a powerful tool for managing local administrator passwords securely. Here's a detailed overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Cloud LAPS ensures that each device has a unique, complex local administrator password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
2. **Centralized Management**: Intune provides a centralized platform for managing local admin passwords, simplifying administration.
3. **Automated Password Rotation**: Automatically rotates passwords on a schedule, ensuring they remain secure.
4. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring secure management of local admin accounts.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring Cloud LAPS can be complex and time-consuming, especially for large organizations.
2. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance is required to ensure the system remains secure and functional.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Potential compatibility issues with older devices or systems that do not fully support Cloud LAPS.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security without needing to take additional actions.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Properly configured Cloud LAPS can be deployed with minimal disruption to users.
- **Recovery Support**: Users have access to recovery options if they forget their local admin password.

### Steps to Deploy Cloud LAPS
1. **Enable Cloud LAPS**: In the Azure Active Directory (AAD) or Microsoft Entra Admin portal, navigate to Devices > All devices > Device Settings. Toggle the option to enable Microsoft Entra Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to "Yes" and save.
2. **Configure Intune Policies**: In Intune, create a new policy for account protection and configure the LAPS settings, including password complexity and rotation schedule.
3. **Assign Policies**: Assign the LAPS policy to the appropriate groups of devices or users.
4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the deployment and make adjustments as needed.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying Cloud LAPS through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Cloud LAPS enforces unique, complex passwords for local admin accounts, ensuring only authorized access.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated passwords help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By managing local admin passwords centrally, Cloud LAPS reduces the potential attack surface.
