# 018: Review security, compliance, resource access requirements (Certs/Wi-Fi/VPN)

## Overview
### Options for Certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN for MDM for iOS in Intune

When managing iOS devices with Microsoft Intune, you have several options for configuring certificates, Wi-Fi, and VPN settings. These configurations are crucial for ensuring secure and seamless access to corporate resources. Here’s a detailed look at the available options, their benefits, and how they contribute to a Zero Trust security posture.

#### Certificates

**Options**:
1. **Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)**:
   - **Purpose**: Automates the issuance and renewal of certificates.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for large-scale deployments where automated certificate management is needed¹(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/certificates-configure).

2. **Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a more controlled certificate issuance process.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for environments requiring high security and manual certificate management¹(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/certificates-configure).

3. **Imported PKCS Certificates**:
   - **Purpose**: Allows importing pre-issued certificates.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for integrating with existing certificate infrastructures¹(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/certificates-configure).

**Benefits**:
- **Enhanced Security**: Certificates provide strong authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access²(https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/docs/workshop-guidance/devices/RMD_179).
- **Seamless User Experience**: Users can access resources without repeatedly entering credentials²(https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/docs/workshop-guidance/devices/RMD_179).
- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the deployment and management of certificates across all devices²(https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/docs/workshop-guidance/devices/RMD_179).

#### Wi-Fi

**Options**:
1. **Basic Wi-Fi Configuration**:
   - **Purpose**: Connects devices to a Wi-Fi network using SSID and password.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for simple network setups(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-edLIdPu-FE).

2. **Enterprise Wi-Fi Configuration**:
   - **Purpose**: Uses certificates for authentication (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise).
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for secure corporate networks requiring strong authentication(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-edLIdPu-FE).

**Benefits**:
- **Automated Connectivity**: Ensures devices automatically connect to the corporate Wi-Fi network.
- **Improved Security**: Enterprise configurations provide stronger security through certificate-based authentication.
- **User Productivity**: Reduces the need for manual Wi-Fi configuration by users.

#### VPN

**Options**:
1. **Per-App VPN**:
   - **Purpose**: Directs traffic from specific apps through a VPN.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for securing sensitive app data without routing all device traffic through the VPN(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eZNwYB6DZ4).

2. **Device-Wide VPN**:
   - **Purpose**: Routes all device traffic through a VPN.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where all network traffic needs to be secured(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eZNwYB6DZ4).

**Benefits**:
- **Secure Access**: Ensures secure connections to corporate resources, even from remote locations.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated VPN settings help maintain secure access.
- **Flexibility**: Per-app VPN allows for granular control over which apps use the VPN.

#### Zero Trust Security Posture

**Zero Trust** is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request. Here’s how these configurations align with Zero Trust principles:

1. **Verify Explicitly**:
   - **Certificates**: Provide strong, certificate-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access resources.
   - **Wi-Fi**: Enterprise Wi-Fi configurations use certificates to authenticate devices, ensuring secure network access.
   - **VPN**: VPN profiles enforce secure connections, ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network.

2. **Use Least Privilege Access**:
   - **Per-App VPN**: Limits VPN usage to specific apps, reducing the attack surface.
   - **Conditional Access**: Intune policies can enforce conditional access, ensuring that only compliant devices can access sensitive resources.

3. **Assume Breach**:
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Integrates with mobile threat defense solutions to continuously monitor device health and compliance(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).
   - **Automated Remediation**: Policies can automatically remediate non-compliant devices, maintaining a secure environment(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune).

By leveraging these configurations, organizations can enhance their security posture, streamline device management, and ensure compliance, all while adhering to the principles of Zero Trust.
