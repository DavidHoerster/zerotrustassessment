# 090: Certificates

## Overview

**Benefits:**
1. **Enhanced Security:** Intune allows you to manage certificates on Android devices, ensuring secure communication between apps and services.
2. **Granular Control:** You can deploy certificates selectively to specific users or groups, granting access only to authorized individuals.
3. **App Configuration:** Intune lets you configure apps with certificates, simplifying app deployment and ensuring proper authentication.
4. **Compliance:** Certificates help enforce compliance policies, ensuring devices meet security standards.

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Complexity:** Managing certificates can be intricate, especially for large organizations with diverse device types.
2. **User Experience:** Users might encounter prompts when certificates are installed or renewed, impacting their workflow.
3. **Certificate Expiry:** If certificates expire, apps relying on them may fail, causing disruptions.

**Impact to End Users:**
- For user-based management methods (such as Android Enterprise personally owned with a work profile, corporate-owned work profile, fully managed, and AOSP user-based), Android devices running Android 9 or earlier will no longer be supported after October 2024.
- Intune won't provide technical support or address issues for unsupported Android OS versions, so it's essential to keep devices up-to-date.

Remember to use Intune reporting to identify affected devices and prepare accordingly!
