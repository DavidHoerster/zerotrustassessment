# 184: Native update management

## Overview

Managing native updates for macOS devices using Microsoft Intune involves several steps to ensure devices are up-to-date, secure, and compliant. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy Native Update Management

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary licenses for Microsoft Intune.
   - Verify that macOS devices are enrolled in Intune and connected to the internet.

2. **Configure Update Policies**:
   - Sign in to the Intune admin center.
   - Navigate to **Devices > Update policies for macOS > Create profile**.
   - On the **Basics** tab, specify a name and description for the policy.
   - On the **Update policy settings** tab, configure the following options:
     - **Critical, Firmware, Configuration file, and All other updates**: Choose actions like download and install, download only, install immediately, notify only, or install later.
     - **Max User Deferrals**: Specify the maximum number of times a user can postpone an update.

3. **Assign Update Policies**:
   - Assign the update policies to the relevant device groups to ensure they are applied across all targeted macOS devices.

4. **Monitor Update Status**:
   - Use the Intune admin center to monitor the update status of devices.
   - Check for any issues and troubleshoot as neededÂ².

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures devices are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the management of software updates across all macOS devices from a single console.
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure devices comply with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

### Drawbacks

- **Complex Setup**: Initial configuration and setup can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Dependency on Internet**: Updates require devices to be connected to the internet.
- **User Experience**: Users might experience interruptions during the update process.

### Impact on End Users

- **Performance**: Users might notice a slight decrease in performance during updates.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications related to software updates.
- **Seamless Updates**: Users benefit from automated updates, reducing the need for manual intervention.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying native update management for macOS devices aligns with the Zero Trust security model by ensuring that:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every access request and action is continuously verified, regardless of where the request originates.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Assume Breach**: The system is designed with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, ensuring robust detection and response mechanisms.
