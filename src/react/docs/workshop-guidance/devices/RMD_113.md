## Overview

## Benefits

**Real-Time Support:** Remote Assist allows IT support staff to provide real-time assistance to users, helping them resolve issues quickly and efficiently.

**Screen Sharing and Control:** IT administrators can view and control the user's device screen, making it easier to troubleshoot and fix problems remotely.

**Unattended Access:** For devices like digital signage or those needing maintenance during off-hours, Remote Assist supports unattended access, allowing IT to perform tasks without user interaction.

**Compliance Warnings:** Before connecting, IT staff can see compliance warnings, ensuring they are aware of any potential security risks on the device.

## Drawbacks

**Privacy Concerns:** Users might be concerned about their privacy, especially if full control of their device is granted to IT staff.

**Dependency on Connectivity:** Remote Assist requires a stable internet connection, which might not always be available.

**Complex Setup:** Initial setup and configuration can be complex, requiring careful planning and execution.

## Impact on End Users

**Improved Support:** Users receive faster and more efficient support, reducing downtime and improving productivity.

**Minimal Disruption:** With features like unattended access, support can be provided with minimal disruption to the user's workflow.

**Training and Awareness:** Users may need to be informed about how Remote Assist works and what to expect during a support session.

## Relation to Zero Trust

**Continuous Monitoring:** Remote Assist supports the Zero Trust principle by enabling continuous monitoring and validation of device compliance.

**Least Privilege:** Access controls can be configured to ensure that IT staff only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, aligning with the principle of least privilege.

**Proactive Security:** By providing real-time support and addressing issues promptly, Remote Assist helps maintain a proactive security posture, which is a key aspect of Zero Trust.
