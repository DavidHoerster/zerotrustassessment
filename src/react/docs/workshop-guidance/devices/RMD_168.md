# 168: Policies for Office Apps

## Overview

There are two primary options for management of Microsoft 365 apps for Windows in Intune, **Policies for Office apps** and **ADMX management**:

* **Policies for Office apps** in Intune allow administrators to configure and enforce settings for Microsoft 365 applications. These policies can control features like macro settings, protected view, and trusted locations, ensuring that Office apps comply with organizational security standards. They are straightforward to implement and manage directly within the Intune admin center, making them ideal for organizations looking for a seamless way to enforce Office app configurations.

* **ADMX management** in Intune involves using Administrative Templates to configure group policy settings for Windows and Office applications. ADMX templates provide a more granular level of control, allowing administrators to manage thousands of settings, including those for third-party applications. This method is beneficial for organizations with complex policy requirements or those needing to import custom ADMX files.

Customers might prefer Office app policies for their simplicity and ease of use, especially if they only need to manage standard Office settings. On the other hand, ADMX management is suitable for more complex environments requiring detailed configuration and control over a broader range of settings.
