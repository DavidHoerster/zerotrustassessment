# 100: RBAC

## Overview

## Benefits

1. Granular Permissions: RBAC allows administrators to assign specific permissions to different roles, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need

2. Improved Security: By limiting access based on roles, RBAC reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data

3. Simplified Management: Administrators can easily manage permissions and roles from a central console, making it easier to enforce security policies

4. Compliance: Helps organizations meet compliance requirements by ensuring that only authorized users can access certain data and applications

## Drawbacks

Complex Setup: Setting up RBAC can be complex and time-consuming, especially in large organizations with many roles and permissions

Maintenance Overhead: Regularly updating and maintaining roles and permissions can be challenging, requiring ongoing administrative effort

Potential for Misconfiguration: Incorrectly configured roles can lead to either excessive access or insufficient access, impacting productivity and security

## Impact on End Users

Access Control: Users will only have access to the resources necessary for their roles, which can streamline their workflow and reduce distractions

Security Measures: Users might experience additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, based on their role

Support and Training: Users may need training to understand their access levels and how to request additional permissions if needed

## Relation to Zero Trust

Least Privilege Principle: RBAC aligns with the Zero Trust principle of least privilege by ensuring users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks

Continuous Verification: Intune's RBAC supports continuous verification of user permissions, ensuring that access is always appropriate and secure

Conditional Access: RBAC can be integrated with conditional access policies to enforce strict access controls based on user roles and device compliance
