# 128: Office Apps

## Overview
### Deploying Office Apps on Windows Devices in Microsoft Intune

**Deploying Office apps** on Windows devices using Microsoft Intune involves assigning and installing Microsoft 365 apps (formerly Office 365) to managed devices. This process ensures that users have access to essential productivity tools while maintaining organizational control over software deployment.

#### Benefits
1. **Centralized Management**: Administrators can deploy, update, and manage Office apps from a single console, simplifying the process.
2. **Automated Updates**: Office apps can be automatically updated, ensuring users always have the latest features and security patches.
3. **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent set of applications across all managed devices, reducing compatibility issues.
4. **User Convenience**: Users can install Office apps through the Intune Company Portal, providing a seamless experience.

#### Drawbacks
1. **Complexity**: The deployment process can be complex, especially if there are existing Office installations that need to be removed first.
2. **Potential Data Loss**: If Office apps are open during installation, users might lose unsaved data.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Conflicts can arise if different versions of Office apps are installed, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

#### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Productivity**: Users have access to essential Office apps, enhancing their productivity.
- **Seamless Updates**: Automated updates ensure users always have the latest features without manual intervention.
- **Potential Disruptions**: Users might experience disruptions if installations or updates occur while they are working on important tasks.

#### Relation to Zero Trust
Deploying Office apps with Intune aligns with the **Zero Trust** security model by:
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Only compliant devices can install and use Office apps, enforcing security policies.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Devices are continuously monitored to ensure they remain compliant with security standards.
- **Conditional Access**: Integration with Conditional Access policies ensures that only trusted devices and users can access Office apps.
