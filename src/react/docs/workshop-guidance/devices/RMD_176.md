# 176: AV/EDR

## Overview

Deploying Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions for macOS devices using Microsoft Intune can significantly enhance your organization's security posture. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy AV/EDR

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure macOS devices are enrolled in Intune.
   - Verify that devices meet the system requirements for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

2. **Add Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**:
   - Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center.
   - Navigate to **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add**.
   - Select **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** for macOS from the app type list.

3. **Create Configuration Profiles**:
   - Go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
   - Select **macOS** for the platform and **Templates** for the profile type.
   - Choose the necessary templates, such as system extensions, network extensions, and full disk access.

4. **Deploy the App**:
   - Assign the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app to the relevant user or device groups.
   - Ensure the app is installed on all targeted macOS devices.

5. **Configure AV/EDR Policies**:
   - In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Antivirus**.
   - Create and configure antivirus policies, including real-time protection, cloud-delivered protection, and automatic sample submission.
   - Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint detection and response** to configure EDR policies.

6. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Continuously monitor the deployment status and compliance of devices.
   - Update policies as needed to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Provides robust protection against malware and other threats.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: EDR capabilities allow for continuous monitoring and quick response to security incidents.
- **Unified Management**: Manage AV/EDR settings alongside other device configurations in Intune.
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure devices comply with organizational security policies.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring AV/EDR policies and deploying the app can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Resource Intensive**: AV/EDR solutions can consume significant system resources, potentially impacting device performance.
- **Learning Curve**: IT staff may need training to effectively manage AV/EDR solutions.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced protection against threats, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Performance Impact**: Users may experience a slight decrease in device performance due to the resource-intensive nature of AV/EDR solutions.
- **Seamless Experience**: Properly configured policies can lead to a smoother user experience with fewer disruptions.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying AV/EDR solutions for macOS devices aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures that devices are continuously monitored and verified before granting access.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
