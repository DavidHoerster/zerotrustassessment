# 131: MDM based policies for certs

## Overview
Deploying certificates to Windows devices using Microsoft Intune is a powerful way to enhance security and streamline authentication processes. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Certificates provide a secure method for authentication, reducing the reliance on passwords which can be compromised.
2. **Seamless User Experience**: Users can access resources without repeatedly entering credentials, improving productivity.
3. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring secure access to corporate resources.
4. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows for centralized deployment and management of certificates, simplifying administration.

### Drawbacks
1. **Complex Setup**: Initial configuration, especially for on-premises components like NDES, can be complex and time-consuming.
2. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance of the certificate infrastructure is required to ensure continued security and functionality.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Potential compatibility issues with older devices or applications that may not fully support certificate-based authentication.

### Impact on End Users
- **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security without the need for complex passwords.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Properly managed certificates reduce the risk of downtime due to authentication issues.
- **User Training**: Some users may require training to understand the new authentication process.

### Configuring an NDES Server
Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) is used to issue and manage certificates for devices. Here are the basic steps to configure an NDES server:
1. **Install NDES**: Install the NDES role on a Windows Server.
2. **Configure NDES**: Set up the NDES service to communicate with your Certification Authority (CA).
3. **Integrate with Intune**: Configure Intune to use NDES for certificate deployment.
4. **Secure NDES**: Ensure the NDES server is secured and accessible only to authorized devices.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying certificates through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: Certificates provide a secure method for authenticating users and devices.
- **Continuous Verification**: Certificates can be used to continuously verify the identity of users and devices accessing corporate resources.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By eliminating the need for passwords, certificates reduce the potential attack surface.
