# 035: Data protection

## Overview
Mobile Application Management (MAM) in Microsoft Intune provides several data protection settings for Android devices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key options available:

### 1. **Data Protection Settings**
These settings control how data is handled within managed applications:

- **Cut, Copy, and Paste**: You can restrict or allow cut, copy, and paste actions between managed and unmanaged apps.
- **Save As**: Control whether users can save files from managed apps to unmanaged locations.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure that data within managed apps is encrypted.
- **Access to Device Features**: Control access to device features like the camera or microphone from managed apps.


These options allow organizations to maintain control over corporate data while providing flexibility for users.
