# 157: Deploy MDM based policies for EDR/AV

## Overview

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policies** configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint settings on devices. These policies include onboarding devices to ensure they are monitored and protected, advanced threat detection for real-time monitoring and alerting, and response tools for actions like isolating compromised devices, running antivirus scans, and collecting investigation packages.

**Antivirus policies** in Intune manage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint antivirus settings. They enable or disable real-time protection, configure scheduled scans, define exclusions for files, folders, and processes, and enable cloud-delivered protection for faster threat detection. These policies ensure continuous monitoring and protection against threats.
