# 141: Update Rings

## Overview

### Update Rings
**Update Rings** in Intune allow administrators to manage how and when Windows 10/11 devices receive updates. These rings are essentially policies that define the deployment schedule for feature and quality updates. Key aspects include:

* Admins can specify deferral periods, deadlines, and active hours to minimize disruption.
* Updates can be deployed in phases to different groups of devices, reducing the risk of widespread issues.
* Ensures devices are up-to-date with the latest security patches, aligning with Zero Trust principles by maintaining a secure and compliant environment.

### Windows Autopatch
**Windows Autopatch** is a service that automates the process of keeping Windows and Microsoft 365 apps up-to-date. It leverages Intune for device management and allow for the management and operation of update rings via **Autopatch Groups**:

* Devices are grouped into these rings to receive updates at different times, allowing for early detection of issues before a broader rollout.
* Microsoft manages the update process, reducing the administrative burden and ensuring timely updates
* Autopatch uses Intuneâ€™s capabilities for device management, reporting, and compliance
