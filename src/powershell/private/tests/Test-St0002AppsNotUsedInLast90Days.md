Removing unused applications improves the security posture and promotes good application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise by someone discovering an unused application and misusing it to get tokens. Depending on the permissions granted to the application and the resources that it exposes, an application compromise could expose sensitive data in an organization.
